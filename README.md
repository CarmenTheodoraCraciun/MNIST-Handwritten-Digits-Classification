# MNIST Handwritten Digits
This repository contains code and resources for the MNIST handwritten digits classification, part of the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/darians-competition-for-intelligent-systems-2024/overview).

## Overview
The objective is to classify handwritten digits into 10 classes (0â€“9). Given a dataset of labeled handwritten images, the goal is to build a classifier that accurately assigns labels to new, unseen images.
